Overfitting is a fundamental issue in supervised machine learning which prevents us from perfectly generalizing the models to well fit observed data on training data, as well as 
unseen data on testing set. Xue (2019) discussed overfitting from the perspectives of causes and solutions. It is worthy to take some notes.
