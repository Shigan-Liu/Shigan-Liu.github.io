The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model is a widely-used tool to simulate the air quality. CMAQ relies on meteorological data to driven the simulated atmosphere so that the emissions, chemical and physical processes could work. We traditionally use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model to provide the meteorological field. This post gives an overview of how the WRF-CMAQ modeling system organized and those data needed.
