# 1. About me
Hello, my name is Shigan Liu. Welcome to my personal website!

I am now a Ph.D. student in Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. My research is focused on the health impacts of atmospheric pollution of particulate matter and the simulation.

## 1.1. Education
2016-2020 **Bachelor** School of atmospheric sciences, Nanjing University           
2020-now **Ph.D.** Department of earth system science, Tsinghua University

## 1.2. Skills
Because my research relies highly on numerical models, such as The Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ), I am capable to use Linux and often write codes to solve problems. I am familiar with shell scripts (e.g. bash/csh), Go language, NCAR Command Language (NCL), and Python and some of its packages like MatPlotLib, Pandas, NumPy and etc. I use EndNote and Evernote to organize the knowledge base, use Word (Microsoft Office), Markdown and LaTeX to write articles and posts.

## 1.3. Publications
