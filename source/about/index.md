# 1. About me
Hello, my name is Shigan Liu. Welcome to my personal page!          

I am now a Ph.D. student in Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. My research is focused on the fusion of multi-source data to quantitatively estimate ground-level atmospheric pollutants concentrations and the source-receptor relation of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>).        

## 1.1. Education
2020-now **Ph.D. Student** Department of earth system science, Tsinghua University        
2016-2020 **Bachelor Degree** School of atmospheric sciences, Nanjing University           

## 1.3. Publications
**Submitted/In preparation:**       
Geng, G., Xiao, Q., <u>**Liu, S.**</u>, Liu, X., Cheng, J., Zheng, Y., Tong, D., Zheng, B., Peng, Y., Huang, X., He, K., & Zhang, Q. (2021). Tracking air pollution in China: Near real-time PM<sub>2.5</sub> retrievals from multiple data sources. [[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06520)]       

# 2. About the website
